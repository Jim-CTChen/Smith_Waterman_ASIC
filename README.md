# Smith_Waterman_ASIC

The aim of this project is to implement a Smith-Waterman accelerator with 256 PEs.

This is the final project of 109-1 NTUEE special project under Prof. Yi-Chang Lu's supervision.

In order to handle longer sequence input, rather than simply making the PE array longer, I add an FIFO at the end of PE array, reducing the cost of the area of PE.
